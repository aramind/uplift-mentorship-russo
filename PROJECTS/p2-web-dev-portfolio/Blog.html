        <p>
          Last week, I watched Darkest Hour. It’s that film about Winston Churchill, directed by Anthony McCarten, with Gary Oldman—one of the GOATs 
          for me—playing the lead. I didn’t even plan to watch it. It just showed up in my Netflix algorithm, and I thought, “Sige na nga.” I didn’t 
          expect it to hit me that hard. Every line, every struggle, it brought me back to a time I honestly don’t like revisiting—the part of my life 
          filled with confusion, self-doubt, and quiet battles nobody knew I was fighting.
        </p>

        <p>
          It all started when I entered college. Sixteen lang ako noon. Bata pa, to be honest. I knew nothing about the world outside. My mom raised me 
          with so much care—maybe too much. From nursery until high school, she was always there, guiding me through everything. Then, all of a sudden, ayun, 
          iniwan ako sa Makati. A whole new world. Fast-paced, loud, and busy. The first few weeks? Grabe. Culture shock talaga.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still remember the first time I took the MRT. Ang daming tao. Everyone rushing, talking, laughing, or just staring at their phones. I was 
          there—quiet, clueless—trying to figure out how to survive that jungle. My soul, if I can call it that, was startled. Ang gulo, ang ingay, ang init. 
          As an ambivert, sobrang draining ng energy. Every day felt like a battle. From Quezon City to Buendia, tapos lalakad pa ako papuntang Mapúa Makati. 
          Minsan, nanginginig na ‘yung tuhod ko kakahintay ng jeep o kakasiksik sa tren.
        </p>

        <p>
          Little by little, nawala ‘yung motivation ko. That fire I had in high school? Gone. I just wanted to rest. After the long commute, I’d sit in class 
          half-asleep. Pag-uwi, derecho ligo, tapos tulog agad. Minsan, hindi na ako kumakain ng dinner. Hindi na rin ako nagre-review. Parang robot.
        </p>

        <p>
          And because I felt empty, I tried to fill it with things I thought would help. I started drinking, smoking, playing Dota 2 for hours. It became an escape. 
          Pero habang tumatagal, mas lalo akong nalulunod. I lied to my friends, and worse, to myself. Every day, I told myself, “Okay lang, babawi rin ako.” Pero 
          deep down, I knew I was just running away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three years went by like that. Tatlong taon na parang tinapon ko lang. I failed subjects, lost interest, and eventually, I dropped out in 2019. That was one 
          of my lowest points. Sobrang bigat. I thought I had no future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came the pandemic. Kung down na ‘yung spirit ko noon, lalo pang bumagsak. Days blurred together. Every morning felt the same—tulog, kain, laro, repeat. 
          Until one day, my mom told me, “Anak, try mo ‘tong trading.” I didn’t know what to expect, but I said yes.
        </p>

        <p>
          That was 2020. At first, trading felt like another maze. Ang daming aral, ang daming charts, ang daming mali. But I pushed through. Slowly, I learned the discipline, 
          patience, and mindset it required. Trading tested me in silence—it was just me, the charts, and my thoughts. For years, I kept going. It wasn’t always easy, but it 
          helped me grow in ways I didn’t expect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then 2025 came, and I felt something shifting. Parang may bulong sa loob ko na, <em>“It’s time for something new.”</em> I prayed, and I realized—God was opening another 
          door. So I took a leap of faith again. Pumasok ako sa bootcamp—this time, for web development, MERN stack.
        </p>

        <p>
          And while I was there, naalala ko bigla ‘yung quote ni Churchill sa Darkest Hour, doon sa train scene—yung quote from Horatius: <em>“How can man die better than facing fearful odds?”</em> 
          Grabe, tinamaan ako ulit. I thought, maybe this is it again. God was giving me a chance to face my fears, to rebuild, to walk the right path this time.
        </p>

        <p>
          That moment hit different. I realized, life really does give second chances—but you have to be brave enough to take them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bootcamp was tough. Coding, debugging, late nights, imposter syndrome—it felt like college all over again. Pero this time, I wasn’t the same person. I wasn’t running anymore. 
          I was fighting. Every bug I solved, every project I finished, it felt like reclaiming a piece of myself I thought I’d lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          And when I think about Darkest Hour now, I get it. Churchill’s courage wasn’t about being fearless. It was about standing tall when everything looked impossible. Ganun din siguro sa 
          buhay. Hindi mo kailangang siguradong manalo. Kailangan mo lang piliin na lumaban araw-araw.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back, I realized something: courage isn’t loud. Minsan, tahimik lang siya—like getting up after failure, trying again after wasting years, or choosing faith over fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life will keep testing you. But maybe that’s what makes it beautiful—the chance to rise again.
        </p>

        <p>
          And maybe, just maybe, that’s where real victory begins.
